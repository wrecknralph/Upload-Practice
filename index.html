  <h1>Hi, I am Bradley Thompson.</h1>
  <h3>
    A few of my hobbies are gaming and airsoft. I am currently a student at Clover Park Technical College. I currently work at Journeys Kidz at the mall. <br>I am a junior in highschool coming off of the running start program and I am in college to learn more about computer programming.
    A lot of my freetime is spent either gaming, airsofting, or spending time with friends. <br>I love spending time outside, especially surrounded by friends. I also enjoy driving a lot, it can be relaxing at times. It's very nice having the freedom to take my self places.
    <br>I am looking to become a softwear enginer in the future and a lot of that is going to come from my commitment to this college. My biggest inspiration is my father who has shown me tips along the way, I have recieved a lot of support from him and I understand coding more because of that.
